[02/05/2023, 18:02:07] Jonathan Karl: that's my last state of knowledge
[02/05/2023, 18:02:15] ~ Josh: Defo
[02/05/2023, 18:02:18] Jonathan Karl: even though @4915222146828 did they confirm?
[02/05/2023, 18:02:52] ~ Josh: I think they need a few more players, but I think as long as we have 22 between us we go ahead? Some subs would be ideal though …
[02/05/2023, 18:03:18] Jonathan Karl: Wait what
[02/05/2023, 18:03:26] Jonathan Karl: You want some of us to play for the enemy?
[02/05/2023, 18:03:33] ~ Josh: Ideally not … 😂
[02/05/2023, 18:03:48] Jonathan Karl: Outrageous
[02/05/2023, 18:03:58] ~ Josh: What to destroy them fair and square
[02/05/2023, 18:04:01] ~ Josh: Want *
[02/05/2023, 18:05:00] Collins: 😂😂😂
[02/05/2023, 18:05:33] ~ Jack: Score a few own goals?
[02/05/2023, 18:16:07] Patrick Kimani: This is why @254794070801 comes in 🤭 can you offer our opponents +plus players 🤔
[02/05/2023, 18:17:35] Jonathan Karl: but not that one dude from a few weeks ago. I want him on our team if he plays hahah
[02/05/2023, 18:18:26] ~ Philipp: Yeah I think they have 8 now, but let me ask my friend
[02/05/2023, 18:34:38] Yash Sharma Football: Hahaha apologies I am recovering from a nasty impact on my knee and ankle
[02/05/2023, 18:34:50] Yash Sharma Football: Will be limping for a week at least
[02/05/2023, 18:35:06] Yash Sharma Football: Wish y’all the best for this match, so us proud🥳🥳
[03/05/2023, 13:30:32] ~ Philipp: Will confirm by end of day tomorrow, but looking promising.
[03/05/2023, 13:50:46] Patrick Kimani: On this note can we get some additional bibs of one of the colours we have to make them 11 which we can play with

[03/05/2023, 15:42:43] Patrick Kimani: Versatile player hehehe you would be better playing midfield/winger 🤔. My thoughts
[03/05/2023, 15:46:23] ~ Phyl: Better outfield yes but I saw Collins in goal and he is 50x better than most of us so worth the trade :)
[03/05/2023, 15:49:56] ~ Steve: I’d say if you have a second keeper option Patrick then get him along too. Means Collins doesn’t have to play in goal the whole time and gives us an extra sub to rotate.
[03/05/2023, 16:01:07] Collins: 👍🏼
[03/05/2023, 16:04:40] Jonathan Karl: Also, does anybody have gloves for the keeper?

[04/05/2023, 14:22:33] ~ Devoe Arnold: What time is this game? Sorry can’t find it in the thread
[04/05/2023, 14:45:48] ~ Jack: I think like midday
[04/05/2023, 14:46:10] ~ Jack: But still waiting final confirmation
[04/05/2023, 17:14:27] ~ Philipp: Hi guys, the other team confirmed they have sufficient numbers so the game is on. I'd say we can still add 2 more players if someone is interested or has a +1.

My friend has contacted Karura regarding the time and they said they will let him know tomorrow. Will keep you posted!
[04/05/2023, 17:32:01] Patrick Kimani: 👏👏👏 we are on!
[05/05/2023, 09:02:13] Patrick Kimani: Hi gents what of this proposal, we only need 3 more bibs only. That's KSHS.750 + 300 (transport) = KSHS.1,000
[05/05/2023, 09:21:38] Jonathan Karl: Happy with that
[05/05/2023, 09:21:48] Jonathan Karl: which colour?
[05/05/2023, 09:26:56] Patrick Kimani: We have yellow and red I think
[05/05/2023, 09:27:14] Patrick Kimani: We can get yellow?
[05/05/2023, 09:42:35] Patrick Kimani: Just need 5 guys to contribute KSHS.200
[05/05/2023, 09:43:28] ~ Jack: Yeah. We can all chip in from those that play Sunday? Just add 100 each on top?
[05/05/2023, 11:16:15] Jonathan Karl: What time is this happening actually?
[05/05/2023, 11:46:16] ~ Philipp: We are impatiently waiting for an update from Karura when the pitch is available, which they promised to give today
[05/05/2023, 17:29:34] ~ Philipp: The Karura people kinda ghosted us. Will try to get a confirmation tomorrow. Anyone know of an alternative 11 a side pitch as a backup?
[05/05/2023, 17:36:11] ~ T.: Impala club
[05/05/2023, 17:36:25] ~ T.: Or saint Mary's
[05/05/2023, 17:38:38] Yash Sharma Football: Oshwal center has a comfy 9 a side
[05/05/2023, 17:38:43] Yash Sharma Football: 11 would be a tad crowded
[05/05/2023, 18:05:16] ~ Philipp: Ok we got the Karura pitch, Sunday 4pm kickoff!
[05/05/2023, 18:05:23] ~ Philipp: Hope that works for everyone

[06/05/2023, 10:51:35] Jonathan Karl: I.e. let’s try and add two people
[06/05/2023, 10:52:01] Jonathan Karl: @254784797009 turns out we actually need more. You down?
[07/05/2023, 09:13:50] ~ Philipp: Hey, does someone have a whistle? The ref forgot his at home this morning apparently 😅
[07/05/2023, 09:14:14] ~ Philipp: Otherwise should we plan to meet at the pitch at 15.30h to warm up and discuss our formation?
[07/05/2023, 09:20:56] Jonathan Karl: What about gloves for the goalkeeper?
[07/05/2023, 09:22:04] Patrick Kimani: This is fine
[07/05/2023, 09:24:48] ~ Philipp: I have gym gloves if we have nothing else but not optimal at all
[07/05/2023, 09:52:52] ~ Steve: Guys, I’ve been up ill all night so doubtful I’ll be able to play today. Will see how I’m feeling in a few hours but if anyone has a +1 to invite that’d be good
[07/05/2023, 09:53:24] Collins: Don’t stress about the gloves I’ll be fine
[07/05/2023, 09:54:17] ~ Phyl: your backing the quality of your defence?
[07/05/2023, 09:55:08] Collins: For sure
[07/05/2023, 09:55:23] ~ Phyl: in that case.. find the guy some gloves! :)

[07/05/2023, 10:47:34] Patrick Kimani: Hi Steve, medicate we hope you will be good by 4pm
[07/05/2023, 11:02:13] ~ Philipp: Someone can bring a ball?
[07/05/2023, 13:46:04] Patrick Kimani: Anyone 🤔
[07/05/2023, 13:46:11] ~ Philipp: You have to pay the football fee at the entrance to the park and then keep the bit of paper with you that says you've paid for football. It's 150 for football + the park entry fee depending on your residence status.
[07/05/2023, 13:46:24] ~ Philipp: Do we have 11 yellow bibs?
[07/05/2023, 13:46:47] ~ Philipp: Other team is gonna wear dark colors so we could supplement with white/light colors
[07/05/2023, 13:47:25] Patrick Kimani: I have the 3 bibs I got, whoever has the rest confirm
[07/05/2023, 13:47:30] ~ Josh: I have the bibs we usually play with, not sure how many that is though

[12/06/2023, 12:40:52] Yash Sharma Football: Hello guys, (off topic from football) 

Do any of you have your wives/girlfriends/spouses who moved to Kenya with you ?
What’s the procedure for a UK National to move here if they don’t have a job appointment letter yet ?
Would really appreciate if you could message me to help out on this. Don’t wish to flood the chat. 
Thanks ! 🤝🏻

She's been honest, friendly, reliable and very hard working. She's mostly been cleaning the house and doing laundry but she's keen to learn more skills and quick to pick things up. Highly recommended.
